This is a project developed by Team Hortons for a Hackthon. The system is called "I Love Me". This is aligned with theme "Helping Students in the New Normal". The project is a web application which helps mental health by using different features included inside the website app. I Love Me is a collaboration of useful features that aid students in their studies. The main feature is the self-study mode where the system automatically plays music that will make you more productive, concentrated, and relaxed while studying. Second notable feature is called the "Take a break" is where you can use it whenever you feel burnt out and exhausted from studying. It will prompt different activities such as exercising and meditating to ease your stress. Third is the class setup where you can input your class schedule and the system will prompt an activity for you to do to ready your mind in learning. It would also display all links for subjects for easy access.
